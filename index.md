# Abigail Pickard, PhD 

Thanks for visiting my site and your interest in my research. 
I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at Aston University in the College of Life and Health Sciences. My overarching research interests are child psychology, eating behaviours and child development.  
The current project I am working on is the ESRC funded research Appetite in Preschoolers: Producing Evidence for Tailoring Interventions Effectively (APPETItE) [Appetite website](www.appetite-research.com)


You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/abigailpickard/abigailpickard/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/abigailpickard/abigailpickard/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
